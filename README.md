# OpenAI API Demo

A simple Node.js application demonstrating how to use the OpenAI API to generate AI-powered content, specifically showcasing haiku generation using GPT-4o-mini.

## Features

- ü§ñ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- üìù Haiku generation example
- üîê Environment variable configuration
- üöÄ Easy setup and deployment

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd openAI-api-demo
   ```

2. Navigate to the API directory:
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `api` directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

5. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The application will execute and display a generated haiku about AI in the console.

### Example Output

```
{
  role: 'assistant',
  content: 'Silicon dreams wake,\nAlgorithms dance with thought‚Äî\nFuture whispers now.'
}
```

## Configuration

The application uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | Yes |
